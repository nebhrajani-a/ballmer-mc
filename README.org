Video transcript:

#+begin_quote
I'm thinking of a number between one and a hundred. You can guess;
after each guess I'll tell you [whether your guess is] high or low.
You get it [on] the first guess, I'll give you five bucks, [you get it on
the second guess] four bucks, three bucks, two [bucks], one, zero, you
pay me a buck, you pay me two, you pay me three. And the question is,
"do you want to play or not?"
